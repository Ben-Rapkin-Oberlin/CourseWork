HW5: Experiments and Technical Writing

1. I was the only group member
2. Overall the project went ok. I think in hindsight that I could have done it much much faster now that I know the libaries better. Additionally, I wasn't fully sure about how much detail to provide for the final paper and I hope it meets all the criteria. I used the accuracy chart instead of a table which I hope is ok for the conclusion.

3. 9 Hours
4. I have adhered to the honor code
