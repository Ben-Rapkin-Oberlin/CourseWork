decode will decode a binary file, it assumes the tree is on line 1
and the encoded text is on line 2. It takes a file from the command
line. For whatever reason argv[0] seems to be a arbitray int when
the code is run, so it checks for file name in argv[1]

decode.c is the source code for decode.c

workHorse.c is where building the tree occurs

workHorse.h is the header file for workHorse.c

there are no known bugs

we adhered to the honor code.
